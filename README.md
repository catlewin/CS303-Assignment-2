Program ran in CLion.

**Part 1**

- implements an integer linked list, first creating 10 nodes through iteration then modifying the linked list with LL class methods.
- implements a string linked list, first with 5 nodes then modifying the linked list with LL class methods.

**Part 2**

- creates instance of vector based stack then modifies the stack with stack class methods.
